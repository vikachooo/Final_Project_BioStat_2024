## Background
<br>
**Motivation:** Acute stroke is one of the leading causes of death. Stroke is the predominant cause of disability in the Russian Federation (3.2 per 1000 population). In RF, according to the results of the 2006 Helsingfors Conference, the two-level model of emergency and specialized medical care for patients with acute stroke was created. Its improvement, which is a driving force of the reorganization and modernization of hospitals receiving stroke patients, requires permanent monitoring with further analysis and forecasting of key indicators and parameters.
<br>
**Aim:** To explore trends and reveal patterns in the provided data and, if patterns are identified, try to predict a) the workload of hospitals in the periods of interest within a calendar year; b) predict the achievement of key quality indicators of the Russian Ministry of Health.
<br>
**Objectives:**
<br>
1. Form a structured database from the provided separate files of weekly monitoring.
2. Study missing data and perform imputation.
3. Explore and visualize the trends for key indicators.
4. Build and assess forecasting models for workload metrics.
